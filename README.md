# Hardware Benchmark in C++

TODO list:
- Image color swap, int8 to float32 convert and 0.0-1.0 rescale
- Image gaussian blur
- Gaussian function
- Sigmoid function
- FFT function

Benchmark between:
- C++ pure for all platforms (with/without optimisation and approximation)
- C++ STL for all platforms backend optimisation not garantied
- C++ with OpenCV for supported platforms
